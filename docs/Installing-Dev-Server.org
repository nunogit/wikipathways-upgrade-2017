#+title: Setting up a development server

These directions assume that you are familiar enough with virtualization software such as [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]] to set up a virtual machine which is network accessible from the host machine.  You will need to be able to ssh into the machine.

* Use the ISO to install a pre-configured Ubuntu server

You can download the CD image from http://vm1.wikipathways.org/ubuntu-18.04-netboot-amd64-unattended.iso (The CD is created using [[https://github.com/wikipathways/linux-unattended-installation][this repository]]

Set up a virtual machine with a 20G or more disk and boot from the ISO.  The installation and set up should take about an hour to create a development environment without any interaction.

Boot the machine without the ISO and log in as =root= with the password =wikiwiki=.  At the shell prompt, create a user for yourself and put your user in the =sudo= group.  For example, Anders might do the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# adduser --gecos "Anders Riutta" ariutta
Adding user `ariutta' ...
Adding new group `ariutta' (1000) ...
Adding new user `ariutta' (1000) with group `ariutta' ...
Creating home directory `/home/ariutta' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully

# adduser ariutta sudo
Adding user `ariutta' to group `sudo' ...
Adding user ariutta to group sudo
Done.
#
#+END_SRC

While you are still logged in as root, get your the virtual machine's (VM's) IP address:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# ip -o -4 a
1: lo    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens3    inet 10.5.5.142/24 brd 10.5.5.255 scope global dynamic ens3\       valid_lft 3196sec preferred_lft 3196sec
#+END_SRC

In the above output you can see that the non-localhost address is 10.5.5.142.

Using this ip address and the user you set up, log into the VM with ssh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ssh -l USER 10.5.5.142
The authenticity of host '10.5.5.142 (10.5.5.142)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:rkXM1pVj0zPQwAHIiLOleWorgoN/V+qKM2GfnGsgpFs.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.5.5.142' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

USER@wikipathways-dev:~$
#+END_SRC

At this point, you may want to copy in your =~/.gitconfig= file so you don't have to configure your name and email for git on the VM.

Clone the [[https://github.com/wikipathways/wikipathways-upgrade-2017][wikipathways/wikipathways-upgrade-2017]] repository from github.  I suggest creating =/home/wikipathways.org= and cloning into that path for this since the top level checkout is /not/ the webserver's document root:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
USER@wikipathways-dev:~$ sudo mkdir /home/wikipathway.org; sudo chown USER /home/wikipathways.org
USER@wikipathways-dev:~$ cd /home/wikipathway.org; git clone git@github.com:wikipathways/wikipathways-upgrade-2017 .
#+END_SRC

Once that is done, run setup-site.sh
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
USER@wikipathways-dev:~$ sh setup-site.sh
Enabling site wikipathways.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  systemctl reload apache2
â€¦
#+END_SRC

Finally, create the database specified in =conf/apache2/envvars=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ . conf/apache2/envvars
$ sudo mysqladmin create $WP_DBNAME
$ sudo mysql $WP_DBNAME < wikipathways.sql
$ echo "grant all on $WP_DBNAME.* to $WP_DBNAME@localhost identified by '$WP_DBPASS';" | sudo mysql
#+END_SRC
